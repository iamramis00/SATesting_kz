          <h1>SAT Subject Test</h1>
          <p>is a standardized test administered by the College Board, a non-profit
organization that runs other programs including the PSAT (Preliminary SAT), AP (Advanced
Placement) and CLEP (College-Level Examination Project). The SAT along with the ACT are the
primary entrance exams used by colleges and universities in the United States.</p>
          <p>  According to a 2019 survey conducted by the National Association for College Admission Counseling
(NACAC), just 5.5% of U.S. colleges and universities view Subject Test scores as “considerably
important” in guiding admissions decisions. The number of schools who view Subject Tests as having
“moderate importance” rose significantly from last year’s survey to 18.3%. These stats alone will
inform you that SAT Subject Tests (formerly known as SAT IIs) are not critically important factors at
the vast majority of American universities. However, this doesn’t mean that the answer to the question
of whether you need to take Subject Tests is a definitive “No.”</p>
